# Misc

These are miscellaneous notes that I'm recording as I go along. They may or may not be refactored into other documents later.

## GCC Compiler Explorer

[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) is a great tool for examining the assembly output of C / C++ code.

### Options

```text
Target: x86-64 gcc 14.1
Options: -m32 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic
```

Explanation of options:

| Option      | Description                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-m32`      | Compile for 32-bit x86 (aka i386).                                            |
| `-O2`       | Optimize for speed. Try toggling it to see how it affects generated assembly. |
| `-Wall`     | Enable all warnings.                                                          |
| `-Wextra`   | Enable extra warnings.                                                        |
| `-Werror`   | Treat warnings as errors.                                                     |
| `-pedantic` | Issue all warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++.                      |
