# Dependencies

Dependencies include the following:

- i686-elf toolchain - Compile C/C++ code for the OS we'll be building.
- GRUB- Bootloader for the OS.
- Xorriso - Tool for creating ISO images.
- GNU Make - Build automation tool.
- QEMU - Emulator for testing the OS.

## i686-elf Toolchain

Refer to [GCC Cross-Compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler).

### Toolchain Installation

```console
brew install andy-zhou/cross-compiler/i686-elf-binutils andy-zhou/cross-compiler/i686-elf-gcc andy-zhou/cross-compiler/i686-elf-gdb
```

Bins belonging to this toolchain are prefixed with `i686-elf-`.

### Version Checking

## GRUB

Based on [Installing GRUB 2 on OS X](https://wiki.osdev.org/GRUB#Installing_GRUB_2_on_OS_X).

### Bootloader Installation

Both the source of GRUB and `objconv` are included as submodules in the `bootloader/` subdirectory.

1. Set up submodules with `git submodule update --init`.
2. Build `objconv` with `clang++ -o artifacts/bin/objconv -O2 bootloader/objconv/src/*.cpp`.
3. Navigate to the GRUB source directory with `cd bootloader/grub`.
4. Run `./bootstrap`.
5. Navigate to build/grub with `cd build/grub`.
6. Configure the GRUB makefile with the i686-elf toolchain by running

   ```console
   > ../../bootloader/grub/configure \
       --disable-werror \
       TARGET_CC=i686-elf-gcc \
       TARGET_OBJCOPY=i686-elf-objcopy \
       TARGET_STRIP=i686-elf-strip \
       TARGET_NM=i686-elf-nm \
       TARGET_RANLIB=i686-elf-ranlib \
       --target=i686-elf \
       --prefix=<absolute path to artifacts/>

    [... more above ...]
    *******************************************************
    GRUB2 will be compiled with following components:
    Platform: i386-pc
    With devmapper support: No (need libdevmapper header)
    With memory debugging: No
    With disk cache statistics: No
    With boot time statistics: No
    efiemu runtime: No (cannot compile with -m64 -mcmodel=large -mno-red-zone -nostdlib)
    grub-mkfont: Yes
    grub-mount: No (need fuse or fuse3 libraries)
    starfield theme: No (No DejaVu found)
    With libzfs support: No (need zfs library)
    Build-time grub-mkfont: No (no fonts)
    Without unifont (no build-time grub-mkfont)
    Without liblzma (no support for XZ-compressed mips images) (need lzma header)
    With stack smashing protector: No
    *******************************************************
   ```

7. Run `make` and `make install`.

### Notes

- Maybe TODO: Improve the above command with a script or Makefile.
- I'm not convinced that `objconv` is necessary. While [this thread](https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2016-08/msg00009.html) discusses it, I could build GRUB without ever adding the new binary to the path.
