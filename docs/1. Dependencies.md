# Dependencies

Dependencies include the following:

- i686-elf toolchain - Compile C/C++ code for the OS we'll be building.
- GRUB- Bootloader for the OS.
- Xorriso - Tool for creating ISO images.
- GNU Make - Build automation tool.
- QEMU - Emulator for testing the OS.

## i686-elf Toolchain

Refer to [GCC Cross-Compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler).

### Installation

The native tools available in OS X do not fit well for this project. Luckily, the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager is makes it easy to build the cross compiler.

```console
brew install i686-elf-binutils i686-elf-gcc i386-elf-gdb
```

The recipes are available at:

- [i686-elf-binutils](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/7dfd89029a400f4d27de43832fe3958ca7bbd541/Formula/i/i686-elf-binutils.rb)
- [i686-elf-gcc](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/7dfd89029a400f4d27de43832fe3958ca7bbd541/Formula/i/i686-elf-gcc.rb)
- [i386-elf-gdb](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/7dfd89029a400f4d27de43832fe3958ca7bbd541/Formula/i/i386-elf-gdb.rb) _(i386 marks a compatibility build)_

At a glance, they seem to be approximately equivalent to instructions available on the wiki. Bins belonging to this toolchain are prefixed with `i686-elf-` or `i386-elf-`.
